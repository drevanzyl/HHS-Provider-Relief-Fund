HHS-Provider-Relief-Fund

HHS is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security (CARES) Act; the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPPHCEA); and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, which provide a total of $178 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund (PRF) money and these payments do not need to be repaid.

The Department allocated $50 billion in PRF payments for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. HHS has made other PRF distributions to a wide array of health care providers and more information on those distributions can be found here: https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/cares-act-provider-relief-fund/data/index.html
